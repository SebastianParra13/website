    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am currently enrolled at Seminole State College of Florida under the Digital Media major. I plan to transfer to the University of Central Florida to focus on Game Design. Currently, I am learning about various parts of digital media including the Adobe Creative cloud, as well as website construction, and even video advertising. After attaining my Associates Degree at Seminole State I will look to attain a Bachelor's Degree at UCF.</p>
    <p>I am currrently interested in the visual side of game design, especially character design and concept art. I enjoy learning about the various elements of the digital space such as photoshop, and website design as well. Despite my interest in digital media and game design, my background is mainly in music. I had done traditional music all throughout grade school, and when I graduated I continued pursuing music. I attended Dubspot in New York City, a music production school that focused on music produced through a combination of various software and hardware. Through the courses I learned all about music production in Digital Audio Workstations such as Ableton Live 9 Suite. Other courses at Dubspot focused on sound design, mixing, and mastering.Although I am no longer solely focused on music, working in the digital space is always something I have enjoyed.</p>
